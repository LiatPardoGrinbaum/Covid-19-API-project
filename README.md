# Covid-19-API-project

## description

This project was done as part of the AppleSeeds Fullstack Bootcamp in which I participate.  
The website is showing statistics about Covid-19 (coronavirus) around the world.  
The user can display in a graph of several Covid-19 cases (Total confirmed\critical\recovered\deaths).  
The data may displayed for different continets, entire world or for each country. Some of the data will also be displayed inside a text-box.

## some words about the process of making this happen:

in this API project I used 2 different API's adresses.  
I used Async function to fetch the data, and many other functions for more readable code. I also used some basic methods such as forEach, map, reduce, sort and more. I used events such as click and change.  
I used Postman softwere to explore the API's.  
I used chart.js library to built the graphs.

The webpage is responsive for both desktop and mobile (portrait and landscape) but for a better view I recommend watching it in the landscape mode (I popped a message when the user watches it in the portrait mode).

All countries options and continents data were coded and added with the DOM. Basic buttons and containers divs were hard-coded. most css styling was added in css.

## In conclusion..

I think the most difficult part for me was to understand how to work with both API's and how to combine between them.  
I've studied a lot from this project and had the opportunity to practice and cover many of the main subjects in JavaScript, HTML and CSS I have learned in the last few months.  
I hope you enjoy viewing data with my API website.
